# Menu Child Indicator #
Menu Child Indicator is a Wordpress plugin that uses a snippet of jQuery to add a css class to all menu items who have sub-children. This creates an easy way to show an indicator when a menu item has more pages beneath it.

Designed for WordPress default themes TwentyEleven and higher, as well as child themes based on either template.

See the readme.txt file for more information.
